## Core Features:

- AYUSH Terminology Translation: API that translates AYUSH (traditional medicine) terms into standardized medical codes (e.g., ICD-11) for interoperability with modern healthcare systems. The API will incorporate reasoning to select appropriate translation based on context. It will act as a tool that will determine if this piece of information will be incorporated.
- Data Interoperability Layer: Enables seamless data exchange between AYUSH and allopathic systems, allowing for a unified patient record view. Use open formats where possible.
- Drug Interaction Checker: AI-powered tool that identifies potential interactions between AYUSH and allopathic medications to prevent adverse effects.
- Patient Safety Alerts: Automated alerts within the system that flag potential risks based on combined AYUSH and allopathic treatment data.
- Standardized Data Input Forms: Create UI components for data entry with necessary fields for both AYUSH and Allopathic medicine to collect all relevant health information from a patient and convert to the proper system.
- Unified Patient Dashboard: Create a web dashboard for each patient profile with details on Allopathic treatments/diagnoses in one section and AYUSH in another. Link conditions that have matches in both to highlight any related and/or duplicate items.
- AI-Driven Personalized Treatment Suggestions: AI that analyzes patient data from both AYUSH and allopathic records to provide personalized treatment suggestions, considering potential interactions and contraindications. It will act as a tool that will determine if this piece of information will be incorporated.
- Predictive Analytics for Disease Management: Utilize machine learning to predict disease progression and potential health risks based on the integrated patient data, enabling proactive intervention and preventative care.
